A start at some functionality for filtering genes,
more to come...

Idea:
   have lm and glm filters that take a formula,
   bind the free variables, we supply a function that handles each x
   in turn, assigning things into the environment of the formula,
   then we call lm/glm/etc with the formula.

 This library should now be maintained at a make check level.
