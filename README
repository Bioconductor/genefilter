A start at some functionality for filtering genes,
more to come...

Idea:
   have lm and glm filters that take a formula,
   bind the free variables, we supply a function that handles each x
   in turn, assigning things into the environment of the formula,
   then we call lm/glm/etc with the formula.

 This library should now be maintained at a make check level.

Next:
    Michael is working on a genefinder: methods for finding genes that
  cluster like those in a specified list

   I would like to get a geneplot function, just using image to disply the
   data (it would be nice to be able to use the arrow keys to adjust the 
   image; maybe tcltk).

   We would like some clustering tools for genes and samples.
   It would be nice to get dendrograms on the axes of the plot.
   Color schemes?

   Dan Carr suggested that there was a principle components method for
   ordering the genes that did a bit better than the hierarchical clustering
   we should track that down.
